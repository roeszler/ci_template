# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) 

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Full-stack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website [here](https://roeszler.github.io/ci_template/)!

## Project Description
This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Technology
This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.

## Testing
Additional icons and hyperlinks were included in the site build and tested for practice with general GitPod interface and recall of command line instructions. Not all technologies mentioned in the site have been used, but all have been researched for early learning.
